RESUME TO ANALYZE:
{resume_text}

TARGET JOB DESCRIPTION:
{job_description}

ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK - Be specific and actionable:

1. SKILLS GAP ANALYSIS:
   - What critical technical skills are missing or underemphasized?
   - Which existing skills need stronger positioning?
   - What industry-specific terminology should be added?

2. EXPERIENCE REPOSITIONING:
   - How can existing roles be reframed to match job requirements?
   - What achievements are undersold and need quantification?
   - Which experiences should be emphasized or de-emphasized?

3. LANGUAGE POWER ASSESSMENT:
   - Identify weak/passive language that needs strengthening
   - Find opportunities to use executive-level action verbs
   - Spot areas where impact can be quantified

4. ATS OPTIMIZATION GAPS:
   - List exact keywords from job description missing in resume
   - Identify synonyms that should be replaced with exact matches
   - Note formatting issues that could hurt ATS scanning

5. COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATION:
   - What unique value propositions are missing?
   - How can this candidate stand out from typical applicants?
   - What narrative thread would make this resume memorable?

ORIGINAL RESUME:

TARGET JOB:
{job_description}

STRATEGIC INSIGHTS FROM ANALYSIS:
- Skills to address: {skills_gaps}
- Keywords to integrate: {missing_keywords}
- Priority improvements: {priority_improvements}
- Narrative theme: {narrative_theme}

TRANSFORMATION STRATEGY:

1. **EXECUTIVE LANGUAGE**: Use senior-level action verbs and terminology
2. **STRATEGIC POSITIONING**: Reframe experiences to directly match job requirements  
3. **QUANTIFIED IMPACT**: Add realistic metrics that demonstrate scale and results
4. **KEYWORD INTEGRATION**: Naturally weave in exact keywords from job posting
5. **COMPETITIVE EDGE**: Highlight unique strengths that differentiate from other candidates
6. **ATS OPTIMIZATION**: Ensure perfect scanning while maintaining readability

SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES TO APPLY:
- Replace "worked on" with "architected", "spearheaded", "orchestrated"
- Add team sizes, budgets, timelines, performance improvements
- Use industry-standard terminology and certifications
- Create compelling bullet points with CAR format (Challenge-Action-Result)
- Position candidate as a leader and innovator, not just a contributor

CRITICAL RULES:
✓ Never fabricate experience, skills, or achievements
✓ Keep all factual information 100% accurate
✓ Maintain professional credibility and authenticity
✓ Ensure every change serves the narrative theme
✓ Make it scannable by both ATS and human recruiters
